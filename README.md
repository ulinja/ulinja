ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ulinja. I'm an advocate for free software and student of computer science and digital technology.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in linux system administration, devops and web application development.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a ton of random things :P I want to have a deeper look into JavaScript in the near future.

ğŸ”– My favourite languages are Python and C.
