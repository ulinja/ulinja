👋 Hi, I’m Julian. I'm a free software advocate, student of computer science and freelance web developer and system administrator.

👀 I’m interested in backend-focused web development, deployment automation and a ton of other things.

🌱 I’m currently learning Nix.

🔖 My favourite language is Python.

🛠️ I host most of my stuff on my own [gitea instance](https://git.skyforest.net/jlobbes).
