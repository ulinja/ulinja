👋 Hi, I’m Julian, a software engineer from Europe.

👀 I’m interested in web development & deployment automation, and really passionate about building good software.

🌱 Currently, I am learning Nix 🐧 and Go :shipit:.

🛠️ My go-to technologies are Linux, Python, Docker, Django & Vue.js.

🌐 I host most of my stuff on my own [git server](https://git.lobbes.dev/ulinja).
