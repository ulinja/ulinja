👋 Hi, I’m Julian. I'm a free software advocate, student of computer science and freelance web developer and system administrator.

👀 I’m interested in backend-focused web development, linux system administration, devops and so much more.

🌱 I’m currently learning a ton of random things! If only there were more hours in a day. I want to have a deeper look into machine learning in the near future.

🔖 My favourite languages are Python and C.

🛠️ I host most of my stuff on my own [gitea instance](https://git.skyforest.net/jlobbes).
