👋 Hi, I’m Julian. I'm a full stack software engineer.

👀 I’m interested in backend-focused web development, deployment automation and a ton of other things.

🌱 I’m currently learning Nix.

🔖 My favourite technologies are Linux, Python, Docker, Django & Vue.js.

🛠️ I host most of my stuff on my own [gitea instance](https://git.skyforest.net/jlobbes).
