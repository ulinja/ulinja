ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julian. I'm a free software advocate, student of computer science and freelance web developer and system administrator.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend-focused web development, linux system administration, devops and so much more.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a ton of random things! If only there were more hours in a day. I want to have a deeper look into machine learning in the near future.

ğŸ”– My favourite languages are Python and C.
